Wanted to do too much for the given time, achieved a handshake between 2 clients and
the server. The game only has sprite animation, characte movement and basic 2D collision.
The clients can't communicate with each other due to lack of time. Run on Debug/Release, but always in x86 mode. The latest Visual Studio 2019 version is required, C++ 2a mode is required (latest in Visual Studio 2019).
