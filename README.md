# DungeonCooperation
Dungeon Cooperation is the university project that
allowed me to get really familiar with network 
programming as the whole point of the project was to
create a game that makes use of socket programming.
Due to unfortunate incidents, the project had way less
time to develop than it needed and ended it up with
barely any gameplay and the networking part, although 
developed, largely unused and untested. Still, the 
project was a success landing me a 70% (first).
